# {{ title }}

i always wanted:

- to have a super well-paid job so i can have financial freedom
- a job that is interesting (some tech jobs can be boring)
- do whatever i want with the money i have

in 2024, i _did_ get the high-paying job (actually super high for where i'm living). the job is really exciting, because i get to work on cool things that people actually use. i know that's true because when stuff breaks, i get alerted and see 10 complaints on discord lol. i also think what im doing has changed people's lives, whether that's for the better or worse (idk actually, but i hope it's the former ^\_^). it's great to work on products like that

i would've been super happy with this 2 years ago; i am extremely grateful for it now but im not sure why i feel more unhappy than before. nowadays, i feel there's nothing much to think about to aside from shipping stuff at work, and the occasional hangouts with friends and people i've met. in fact these hangouts make me really really happy, and i always look forward to them, even if its just for a short time

i don't really think of unaliving myself, but i do have days where i feel nothing's gonna change if i don't wake up tomorrow --- and sometimes it feels peaceful, knowing that whatever's bothering me doesn't matter since i can just go to sleep and end it all

but i've never been to the point where i feel like doing it. because i still have a responsiblity towards my job; stuff needs to be fixed and improved. i need to attend my braces and nail appointments, i have a concert next year with my friends (that i don't want to skip), and more importantly, my mum's still waiting for me to bring her to europe lol

i guess i feel like when i come home, there's no one and nothing to live for, just me and my PC, binge watch youtube, and repeat the next day

before i broke up with my ex, one thing i waited for everyday was for her to come back, and i would prepare dinner, watch breaking bad on netflix, and talk about her day and throw in some random convos like planning our next trip. it was fun nice and warm, like when it's raining and you turn on the AC and cover yourself up with a thick ass blanket, real shit

i broke up with her (and i still feel like i made a big mistake for this), and that all just disappeared. i miss the feeling of having someone to share my life with... maybe that's the problem o.O

but at the same time, i don't really complain about this much except to people close to me. 99.99% of the people in the world would kill to be in my position, and i feel like an ungrateful bitch when i think of all this. the kids in gaza,syria,sudan and the ukrainians have it worse than me for example (god bless them). honestly, just anyone i see on the drive to work lately may be going through worse things than me, so maybe i'm not really having a tough time, just first world and privileged problems !

so back to the question, what am i living for? idk really, i hope i can find the reason(s) soon ! :D
