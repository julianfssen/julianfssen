- **ethel cain**: sun-bleached flies, nettles, strangers

"if it's meant to be then it will be" resonates a lot with me right now, and the song is just really good lol. i also like the melody and lyricism of nettles, "think of us inside, gardenias on the tile, where it makes no difference who held back from who" - i wish i could write that! i'd like to watch her live one day but i don't think she's ever going outside of the US ever lol

- **wolf alice**: the sofa, silk, lisbon, how can i make it ok, the last man on earth, and many more ...

i think this band is cool as fuck (their songs too), and i want to be like them if i can. a semi(?) popular band, not to the point where every inch of your life is under the lens of social media, just enough to live a good life making music and touring (although i know it's actually not as glamorous as it is hah). i missed them when they came to good vibes a few years back

- **the 1975**: their entire discography

i was at these dudes concert at good vibes a few years back, and while i do believe in better support for lgbt/queer communities (i think everyone deserves the freedom to live however they want), i think matty probably fucked it up for them at this concert. i think he could have gotten his message across better, and i don't think he ever took responsibility for antagonizing the lgbtqia+ folks here. that said, i still like their music, and i a firm believer in liking the art, but not the arist

- **deftones**: infinite source, + older tunes like drive and entombed

they were popular when i was growing up in the nu-metal era of the 2000s, but i only appreciated them recently. i like to plug in my airpods and blast deftones, i find it to be quite a sensation when the guitars drone out my ears to the point where idk wtf is going, reminds me of my bloody valentine (i think they took some inspiration from mbv actually). good late night driving music too

- **aespa**: dirty work, supernova, next level (cliche shit ik lol)

i heard snippets of their songs while playing pubg, and i liked it. i think the way they switch the beat and melody in songs is pretty cool, and i like their hi-tech/futuristic concepts in their MVs. i'd definitely got to an aespa show if they come here
